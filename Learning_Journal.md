Last week I found out about the rubber duck debugging. I think I'll need that for the project. But today we've got the information about the Coursework,so I decided to think about the tutorials straight away (as I know it's going to be difficult for me). I didn't know where to start, so I just went to Youtube and found the tutorial about the Camera Movement. I started to work on it, applied to the project. But the script was too simple and I didn't know how to apply that to the project, so I decided to try something else.

I've been thinking about the tutorials. The hardest thing for me was ...everything. I tried to find something easy for beginners like me, but not simple. I decided to create the Snake Game. 
##### 15/10/2019
Today I started to research the scripts I might use for my Snake game. I started it as a 2D project, but I thought that I would spend more time on drawing assets rather than scripting, so I decided to create a 3D snake game. I never worked with a 3D project before. 
##### 22/10/2019
Today I finally created the project. Created the scene and made the SnakeSnake moving around the scene and changing the direction. I didn't have any difficulties with that and found the solution on the Unity forum. Started to work on the tutorial.

The hardest thing for me now - is to explain the script. To understand it - I have to translate it to my language. And if I found the solution in my language - to translate it to English (which, I'm sure, made it not understandable). I'm reading the essential explanations about things like "variables" "floats" "bools" etc. However, I've finished the first tutorial.

During today I've been thinking how to make the tail for the SnakeSnake.  I don't know where to start and just tried different things. Firstly I decided to make the tail elements invisible and make them active during the game. But I think it's wrong. I have made a move from a certain distance from each other.

Yesterday my colleague Yoan helped me with my 3D game. And there I decided to add the same mechanics as in the SnakeSnake - the following script. Unfortunately, the one I have in my game now didn't work for the SnakeSnake, but I found another way to make it happen - to create a variable Vector for the distance between tail elements. I applied the script to the project, and it worked.

I worked on the second tutorial today. It's still tough to translate and explain things for me.
##### 19/11/2019
Today I've been working on the food collection for my snake game. The script was easy but kept giving me the errors. Only later I understood that I need to apply the Rigidbody for the Snake'sSnake's head! Also, I learned how to use the earlier created position rule for the new elements of the Snake'sSnake's tail.
##### 26/11/2019
Today I finished the third tutorial.
##### 28/11/2019
For the last tutorial, I decided to create something with the text. I decided to create the game over screen and counting text. I didn't have any difficulties and finished the last tutorial. 
##### 1/12/2019
Today I learned about the Markdown format. Really liked it. So all the tutorials, journal and the task log (whose wherein Word and Excell earlier) I transferred to that format. Seems like my Coursework is ready to be submitted.
